Pose Estimation - *yolo26* with lightweight ONNX postprocessing
================================================================

This example demonstrates pose estimation using a Hailo-10H device, based on the 2026 Ultralytics YOLO26 release of top-performing NMS-free networks and a split HEF + ONNX postprocessing pipeline.

The example takes an input, performs inference using the input HEF file, and draws detection boxes, class type, confidence, keypoints, and joint connections on the resized image.

Supported input formats include:
- Images: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp
- Video: .mp4
- Live camera feed

This application includes additional demo variations that highlight the practical potential of high-quality, high-speed pose estimation:
1. **Skeleton tracklet ("following shadow")** — showcases dense temporal pose recognition enabled by high FPS.
2. **Ultralytics AI Gym integration** — counts fitness exercise repetitions and demonstrates broader action-recognition capabilities.
   In practice, this runs smoothly only with Hailo acceleration, as the 2–3 FPS typically achievable on Raspberry Pi CPU with the smallest network is not sufficient for capturing reasonably fast movement.

ONNX postprocessing
-------------------
Similarly to hailo_apps/cpp/onnxrt_hailo_pipeline, this example uses onnxruntime for the postprocessing part.  This makes integration of new networks especially convenient, by following these steps:
1. Split the ONNX into the "neural processing" and the "postprocessing" parts using extract_postprocessing.py script
2. Process the first part into a HEF using the DFC
3. In runtime, apply the second part on the HEF outputs with onnx-runtime engine to complete an accelerated equivalent of the original ONNX. This runtime part is implemented and exemplified in this app.
4. The desired "debug reference ONNX = HEF + postproc-onnx" equivalence can be tested by passing --neural-onnx-ref <path>, which bypasses HEF inference and feeds postprocessing from a user-provided reference ONNX model. This is useful for quick dry tests and for isolating pipeline-vs-compilation differences.


## Linux Installation

Run this app in one of two ways:
1. Standalone installation in a clean virtual environment (no TAPPAS required) — see [Option 1](#option-1-standalone-installation)
2. From an installed `hailo-apps` repository — see [Option 2](#option-2-inside-an-installed-hailo-apps-repository)

### Option 1: Standalone Installation

To avoid compatibility issues, it's recommended to use a clean virtual environment.

0. Install PyHailoRT
    - Download the HailoRT whl from the Hailo website - make sure to select the correct Python version. 
    - Install whl:
    ```shell script
    pip install hailort-X.X.X-cpXX-cpXX-linux_x86_64.whl
    ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```shell script
    git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps.git
    cd hailo-apps/python/standalone_apps/pose_estimation_onnx_postproc
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```shell script
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Option 2: Inside an Installed hailo-apps Repository
If you installed the full repository:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps.git
cd hailo-apps
sudo ./install.sh
source setup_env.sh
```
Then the app is already ready for usage:
```shell script
cd hailo-apps/python/standalone_apps/pose_estimation_onnx_postproc
```


## Windows Installation

To avoid compatibility issues, it's recommended to use a clean virtual environment.

0. Install HailoRT (MSI) + PyHailoRT
    1. Download and install the **HailoRT Windows MSI** from the Hailo website.
    2. During the installation, make sure **PyHailoRT** is selected (in the MSI “Custom Setup” tree).
    3. After installation, the PyHailoRT wheel is located under:
       `C:\Program Files\HailoRT\python`

    4. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```powershell
    python -m venv wind_venv
    .\wind_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    5. Install the PyHailoRT wheel from the MSI installation folder:
    ```powershell
    pip install "C:\Program Files\HailoRT\python\hailort-*.whl"
    ```

1. Clone the repository:
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps.git
    cd hailo-apps\hailo_apps\python\standalone_apps\pose_estimation_onnx_postproc
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt

After completing either installation option, run from the application folder:
```shell script
python .\pose_estimation.py -n <model_path> -i <input_path>
```

Arguments
---------

- `--hef-path, -n`: 
    - A **model name** (e.g., `yolov8m_pose`) → the script will automatically download and resolve the correct HEF for your device.
    - A **file path** to a local HEF → the script will use the specified network directly.
- `-i, --input`:
  - An **input source** such as an image (`bus.jpg`), a video (`video.mp4`), a directory of images, or `usb` to auto-select the first available USB camera.
    - On Linux, you can also use /dev/vidoeX (e.g., `/dev/video0`) to select a specific camera.
    - On Windows, you can also use a camera index (`0`, `1`, `2`, ...) to select a specific camera.
    - On Raspberry Pi, you can also use `rpi` to enable the Raspberry Pi camera.
  - A **predefined input name** from `resources_config.yaml` (e.g., `bus`, `street`).
